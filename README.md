#Moviebot
#This is a bot created by Rachel Yuan during Raspberry Jam 2016 at UNC.
#Currently, it is not running, because it requires the use of a Raspberry Pi,
#however, some of the tweets can be found at the Twitter handle @rakaiyu2.
#The bot can be divided into three main functions: a random movie generator, which
#accesses a movie generating website; a plot finder, which accesses the OMDB
#API to get the plot of that movie; and a plot parser, which cuts off the
#summary before it exceeds the word limit of Twitter.
#In the future, I would like to expand the bot so that it replaces every word
#of the plot with a synonym, hopefuly generating some humorous content.
